This system detects vehicles, tracks them over time, and provides real-time analytics for any parking area.
🔧 What it can do Customizable parking regions (draw your own slots with an interactive ROI tool) Real-time count of occupied vs. available parking spaces Per-vehicle parking duration tracked automatically Easy to adapt for new videos, layouts, or models
⚙️ How it works Define parking slots interactively using draw_roi_parking.py Run the detection + tracking pipeline with yolo_parking.py Get a fully annotated output video with live stats
💡 Why it’s useful A fast, lightweight prototype for: Parking management & monitoring Garage automation Drone/aerial analytics Students or engineers learning applied computer vision
How to run
Define parking slots first by running -> python draw_roi_parking.py Instructions: Left click + drag: draw a rectangle for a parking slot 'u': undo last slot 'r': reset all slots 's': save to JSON and exit 'q' or ESC: exit without saving
After defining the parking slots, run the parking video by using python yolo_parking.py --video {source} --output {output.mp4} --slots {parking_slots.json} --model {default is yolov8m}
